# Personal Portfolio site
 This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website.
 The website is a static site which is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and further is connected to two dynamic websites, namely, Blogsite and Projects siite. The UI?UX designing of this website is done on Adobe XD and is 100% original.
 
 ## About the design
 
The aim of the site is to be a minimalistic, simple site which can be used by any type of user to navigate through my projects and contact me. Hence the design is created in the most easy-to-eyes way. The maim font face used is Poppins due to the same reason and the primary colors set are blue and white along with some black. The reason behind the color scheme is to create a comfortable screen display.

## About Responsive Behaviour
The site is completely responsive and handles Dark mode of devices well.

## Contribute
